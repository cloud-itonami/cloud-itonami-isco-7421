  "Electronics Mechanic Advisor — proposing a service scheduling/logistics
  coordination operation (log a service record, schedule a service
  operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate an electronics-parts
  supply order) from a technician roster, service-account registration
  and safety-reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the advisor ONLY
  proposes — `electronicsmech.governor` independently gates every
  proposal and always escalates safety concerns and above-threshold
  supply orders. The advisor never proposes to directly finalize an
  electronics-repair-execution decision (e.g. proceeding with a
  specific electronics repair) or to override/bypass a
  shop-safety-officer's judgment — those stay permanently out of this
  actor's scope. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7127's hvacmech.advisor
  (closest domain shape).
